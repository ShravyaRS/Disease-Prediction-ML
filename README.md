# 🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🧬  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict diseases based on symptoms and genetic data. The model analyzes patterns and provides accurate predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Train a model with healthcare data  
✔ Predict diseases from given symptoms  
✔ Support for multiple machine learning algorithms  

## 🔧 How to Use  
1️⃣ Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`  
2️⃣ Run the model using `disease_prediction.py`  
3️⃣ Enter symptoms to get a disease prediction  

## 📂 Dataset  
We use a healthcare dataset containing symptoms and diseases for training.  

## 📊 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)  
- Flask (For Web Interface)
